# Compact JSON Edit Payload Specification

**Status:** implemented
**Decision:** [ADR-0006](../adr/0006-compact-json-edit-payload.md)

## Goal

Reduce repeated JSON keys in model-facing edit calls without changing the verified edit protocol. The tool remains responsible for resolving anchors, checking served state, rejecting stale or unseen ranges, and applying writes atomically.

## Public contracts

### Single `edit`

The complete payload is a fixed three-position JSON array:

```json
["src/file.ts", ["abx", "sdc"], "replacement text"]
```

Positions are:

1. `path`: a non-empty string, or `null` to invoke the existing unique anchor-based path resolution;
2. `range`: a two-element array `[remove_from, remove_to]` of 3-character anchor strings, inclusive at both ends;
3. `replacement_text`: the complete replacement text. An empty string deletes the range.

The payload must have exactly three positions. Missing positions, extra positions, wrong JSON types, empty paths, malformed anchors, and ambiguous path resolution are rejected with the existing `[E_BAD_SHAPE]`/anchor error conventions.

### `batch_edit`

The top-level payload remains an object with exactly one field, `edits`:

```json
{
  "edits": [
    ["src/a.ts", ["abx", "sdc"], "first replacement"],
    [null, ["qwe", "rty"], "second replacement"]
  ]
}
```

Each item is the same fixed three-position tuple as `edit`. Existing batch limits, ordering, overlap checks, served-range verification, all-or-nothing writes, rollback, and persisted undo remain unchanged.

## Normalization and safety

- Both public shapes normalize into the existing internal edit representation before mutation.
- `null` path is normalized through the existing `resolveMissingPath` behavior; it does not create a variable-arity tuple.
- The range array is normalized to the existing `remove_from` and `remove_to` fields.
- No model-supplied digest, expected-hash list, force flag, fuzzy matching, silent remapping, or recovery merge is added.
- Rejection feedback continues to serve fresh rows, so a retry does not require a read.
- The old named-object single-edit and batch-item shapes are not accepted by the new contract.

## Non-goals

- No new tools.
- No exposed format configuration or automatic format detection.
- No textual patch language in this change. Unified diff may be considered later as an explicit interoperability adapter, but it must not bypass served-state verification or enable fuzzy relocation.
- No block operations, registers, file moves/removals, or syntax-aware structural edits.

## Test seams

Tests must exercise public tool schemas and execution seams, not private parser helpers:

- valid single tuple applies the intended replacement;
- `null` path resolves a unique file from the two anchors;
- malformed tuple arity and member types reject before mutation;
- empty replacement preserves deletion behavior;
- old named-object payload is rejected;
- valid batch tuple items preserve ordering and atomicity;
- malformed or stale batch item rejects the entire batch and writes nothing;
- batch limit and existing reject-and-serve behavior remain intact.

## Implementation tickets

1. Implement and test the single `edit` tuple contract, including shared tuple schema/types and prompt guidance.
2. Implement and test tuple items in `batch_edit`, reusing the shared contract and preserving atomic behavior.
3. Update model-facing prompts and contract documentation, then run the full validation suite and review the combined diff.
