# Compact JSON edit payload

**Status:** accepted

The `edit` and `batch_edit` tools use compact tuples inside object-root JSON payloads so OpenAI-compatible function-tool transports can accept their schemas: `edit` is `{ "edit": [path, [remove_from, remove_to], replacement_text] }`, and `batch_edit` is `{ "batch": [ [path, [remove_from, remove_to], replacement_text], ... ] }`. The tuple positions preserve the existing verified edit semantics: the path is a string or `null` for anchor-based inference, the two-anchor range is inclusive, and an empty replacement means deletion. We chose fixed tuples over a textual patch language or a full-file digest because they reduce repeated JSON keys while keeping strict schema validation and the model–tool boundary in which the tool owns verification. The old named-object edit payload and the `edits` wrapper are not retained; textual formats such as unified diff remain deferred interoperability experiments rather than alternate mutation semantics.

## Consequences

- Compact JSON is the sole current payload contract; no new tool or exposed format configuration is added.
- The tuple is intentionally fixed-arity: `null` represents an inferred path rather than an omitted position.
- Both forms must normalize into the existing edit pipeline, including served-state range verification, reject-and-serve, atomic batch preflight, rollback, and persisted undo.
- Syntax-aware structural edits and file-lifecycle operations remain outside the verified line-range contract.
